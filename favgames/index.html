        In my free time, I enjoy playing various games. Since it’s far too difficult to choose just one as my all-time favorite, I’ll be discussing both my favorite board game and my favorite video game.

    <!-- FAV BOARD GAME: PANDEMIC -->
    <h2>
        Favorite Board Game: Pandemic

        Before college, my knowledge of board games was limited to the classics: <span class="italicstyle">Monopoly</span>, <span class="italicstyle">The Game of Life</span>, <span class="italicstyle">Clue</span>, <span class="italicstyle">Scrabble</span>, etc. When I joined The Grid, Baruch’s one-and-only tabletop gaming club, I was surprised to discover there was much more to the genre. In the club, I was introduced to a variety of board games, including <span class="italicstyle">King of Tokyo</span>, <span class="italicstyle">Sheriff of Nottingham</span>, <span class="italicstyle">Settlers of Catan</span>, <span class="italicstyle">Exploding Kittens</span>, and <span class="italicstyle">Unstable Unicorns</span>. My current favorite board game is <span class="italictyle">Pandemic</span> (yes, I am aware of the irony), which The Grid doesn’t own. The club does own <span class="italicstyle">Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu</span>, a Lovecraftian-inspired version, which is how I was first exposed to the franchise. My friends and I played the original <span class="italicstyle">Pandemic</span> for the first time at a board game café called <a href="https://www.sipnplaynyc.com/" target="_blank" title="Check out their website!">Sip N’ Play</a>, and even though we lost, we had a lot of fun! I liked the game so much I even decided to buy <span class="italicstyle">Pandemic</span> as a birthday present for myself this year.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you’re unfamiliar with <span class="italicstyle">Pandemic</span>, it’s a strategic game for 2-4 players where the goal is to cure 4 diseases before time runs out. What I like about this game is that it is cooperative, meaning everyone must work together to win. In most board games I’ve played, players are always competing against each other. Even if two or more people join forces against someone else, like in <span class="italicstyle">King of Tokyo</span> or <span class="italicstyle">Unstable Unicorns</span>, those alliances are temporary since only one player can ultimately win the game. However, in <span class="italicstyle">Pandemic</span>, because everyone either wins or loses as a team, there is no incentive to stab your friends in the back. Rather than competing against each other, you’re competing against the board and the clock! The game is also unforgiving, as infections can quickly spiral out of control if you don’t manage them properly. Since they occur after every player’s turn, every decision matters. What I also like about <span class="italicstyle">Pandemic</span> is even though it’s more complex than most casual games, it’s also easy to learn because every turn consists of the same three phases, and turns repeat around the table until the players either win or lose.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you’re looking for a board game with strategic depth but is also easy to learn, I highly recommend <span class="italicstyle">Pandemic</span>! Maybe wait until after the pandemic to buy a copy for yourself, though…

    <!-- FAVORITE VIDEO GAME: POKÉMON SOULSILVER -->
    <h2>
        Favorite Video Game: Pokémon SoulSilver
    </h2>
    
    <div class="rightpicandcaption soulsilver">

        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The first video games I ever played were <span class="italicstyle">Super Mario Land</span> and <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon Silver</span> on my sister’s Game Boy Color (spoiler: I never finished either). Since then, I’ve played a variety of video games across the Game Boy Advance SP, the Nintendo DS and DSi, the 3DS, and the Nintendo Switch. If I had to pick just one video game from my collection as my favorite, I would choose <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon SoulSilver</span>, for the Nintendo DS.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you’ve never heard of <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon</span>, it's a massive media franchise centered around cute, collectible creatures called—you guessed it—<span class="italicstyle">Pokémon</span>. Each entry in the main series takes place in a different region, but the goal is always the same: choose one of three starters (Fire, Water, or Grass) and set out on a journey to become the strongest Trainer in the region by catching other <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon</span>, training them to be strong in battle, and defeating Gym Leaders and other Trainers.
    </p>
    <p>
        One reason <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon SoulSilver</span> is special is because it was the first Pokémon game I ever finished. Another reason it's my favorite video game is because of all the content Game Freak (the company who designs the main <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon</span> games) managed to cram into it. <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon Gold</span> and <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon Silver</span> are unique in that they are sequels to the first set of <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon</span> games, <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon Red</span> and <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon Blue</span>. As a result, after completing your journey in Johto, the region featured in <span class="italicstyle">Gold</span> and <span class="italicstyle">Silver</span>, you can continue your journey in Kanto, the region from <span class="italicstyle">Red</span> and <span class="italicstyle">Blue</span>, which culminates in a mountaintop 6-on-6 battle against the player character from <span class="italicstyle">Red</span> and <span class="italicstyle">Blue</span>! Not only is this impressive from a game design perspective, but it’s also impressive from a hardware perspective. Despite Gold and Silver being released in 1999, Game Freak was able to fit a game almost twice as large as its previous titles onto a single cartridge. <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon SoulSilver</span>, which is a Nintendo DS remake of <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon Silver</span>, retains the same story campaign while also greatly improving the graphics and user interface. It’s disappointing that most of the mainline <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon</span> titles since then have lacked that same ambition (I’ve heard <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon Black 2</span> and <span class="italicstyle">White 2</span> breaks that trend), even as they made the jump to home consoles with <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon Sword</span> and <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon Shield</span>. Regardless, <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon SoulSilver</span> remains one of my favorite video games of all time.
    </p>
    <p class="finalp">
        Of course, I can’t talk about <span class="italicstyle">Pokémon SoulSilver</span> without giving a shout-out to my main team:
    </p>
    <ul class="uolist">
        <li>Tornami the Feraligatr</li>
        <li>Tesla the Ampharos</li>
        <li>Ballboa the Golem</li>
        <li>Toothless the Dragonite</li>
        <li>Azula the Rapidash</li>
        <li>Machamp (I received him in a trade, so I couldn’t give him a nickname)</li>
