        My favorite musical artist is Owl City, a.k.a Adam Young. You might know Owl City from its popular singles, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psuRGfAaju4" target="_blank" title="Click here to listen to the song!" class="normallink">"Fireflies"</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIz2K3ArrWk" target="_blank" title="Click here to listen to the song!" class="normallink">"Vanilla Twilight"</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7HmzwI67ec" target="_blank" title="Click here to listen to the song!" class="normallink">"Good Time"</a>. A common misconception is that Owl City is a band or Adam Young’s stage name, when in fact Owl City is an electronica musical project created by Adam Young. His other musical projects include Port Blue, which focuses more on imaginative instrumentals, and Sky Sailing, which has a more acoustic sound.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first Owl City songs I listened to were "Fireflies" and "Vanilla Twilight". These two songs stuck with me because of their unique sound and poetic lyrics. "Fireflies" is whimsical and evokes a sense of childlike wonder, while "Vanilla Twilight" is a moving dedication to losing someone and accepting that loss.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I like most about Owl City is its ability to create an atmosphere within its songs, combining imaginative lyrics with electronic instrumentals. I believe the logic of Owl City's lyrics, especially in its earlier music, is not as important as how its songs make you feel. For example, in "Fireflies", he sings:
    </p>
    <p class="songlyrics">
        "'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs <br>
        From ten thousand lightning bugs <br>
        As they tried to teach me how to dance."
    </p>
    <p>
        When I hear these lines, I picture a humorous scene, where fireflies are surrounding a child, who is attempting (and failing) to copy their movements. These lines also make me nostalgic for my childhood, when life was simpler, and my imagination ran wild. In "Vanilla Twilight", he sings:
    </p>
    <p class="songlyrics">
        "But drenched in vanilla twilight <br>
        I'll sit on the front porch all night <br>
        Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you, <br>
        I don't feel so alone."
    </p>
    <p>
        When I hear these lines, I picture the singer sitting on his front porch, staring wistfully at a twinkling night sky. I feel the sadness associated with the singer’s loss, but also the hope that, with time, the singer will come to accept it and live life happily once again.
    </p>
    <p>
        His songs also cover a variety of tones and topics. For instance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKYzqA2Vgco" target="_blank" title="Click here to listen to the song!" class="normallink">"If My Heart Was a House"</a> is a romantic ballad, while "Fireflies" relates to his struggle with insomnia. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zblhY65gPOk" target="_blank" title="Click here to listen to the song!" class="normallink">"Humbug"</a> is a humorous, upbeat holiday song, whereas <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6QiQzf5JGM" target="_blank" title="Click here to listen to the song!" class="normallink">"This Isn't The End"</a> is a poignant song about a daughter coming to terms with her father's suicide. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP95wwpOm9s" target="_blank" title="Click here to listen to the song!" class="normallink">"Verge"</a> is a cheerful graduation tune, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQmXgjod8B0" target="_blank" title="Click here to listen to the song!" class="normallink">"The Real World"</a> ponders whether reality is worth living in. My favorite Owl City song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuk3zJ3CVco" target="_blank" title="Click here to listen to the song!" class="normallink">“House Wren”</a>, which is a lighthearted song about a house wren’s journey to find a home.

        Owl City released its first EP, <span class="italicstyle">Of June</span>, in 2007, and 13 years later, it is still producing music. In fact, its sixth album, titled <span class="italicstyle">Cinematic</span>, was released in June of last year. This album differs from its previous albums in that it is autobiographical, covering topics such as Young’s birth, how he met his current girlfriend, and his very first record deal.

        Owl City is an artist with a unique sound, and I highly recommend its music!
