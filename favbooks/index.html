        As an avid reader, it’s hard for me to choose just one book series as my all-time favorite. My favorite genre is fantasy, so it should come as no surprise <span class="italicstyle">Harry Potter</span> ranks high on my list. However, here I’ll be discussing another one of my favorite series: <span class="italicstyle">Artemis Fowl</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the name of this series sounds familiar, it’s probably because Disney is releasing a movie adaptation of the first book. The series, written by Eoin Colfer, consists of eight books describing the adventures of Artemis Fowl II, a young criminal mastermind who becomes involved with the affairs of the Fairy People. The Fairy People, also known as fairies, consist of a wide range of supernatural creatures, including elves, dwarves, sprites, pixies, and goblins, most of which have magical abilities. They originally lived on the Earth’s surface, but after losing a battle with humans, moved underground, and were gradually forgotten. In the first novel, Artemis sets out to prove their existence, not for fame or knowledge as one might expect, but because he wants their gold.
    </p>
    <p>
        One reason I love the <span class="italicstyle">Artemis Fowl</span> series is because it takes a unique approach to the cliché concept of “another world of magic hidden from the everyday one”. Firstly, The Lower Elements, the underground region where all fairies live, is a fascinating combination of technology and magic. Even though fairy technology is more advanced than anything humans have created, it has not replaced magic; instead, it is used to supplement and improve the lives of fairies. An example of this is the Lower Elements Police (LEP), which relies on weapons and gadgets as well as magic to apprehend criminals and maintain peace. Additionally, the magical creatures featured in <span class="italicstyle">Artemis Fowl</span> are very different from their counterparts in mainstream media. Dwarves, for instance, can tunnel through the ground by devouring dirt and expelling the remains through their rears at incredible speeds. Elves, meanwhile, are around three feet tall with brown skin, and most of them have red or auburn hair. Lastly, although fairies and humans live apart, their worlds frequently interact with one another in believable ways. For example, the LEP is often tasked with resolving and containing fairy-related incidents aboveground to hide their continued existence, sometimes even manipulating the memories of human witnesses. Also, in the world of <span class="italicstyle">Artemis Fowl</span>, there are no leprechauns: the term is a homophone of LEPrecon, one of the LEP’s elite branches; their physical appearance in Irish folklore comes from the LEPrecon’s old green uniforms; and the gold they are believed to carry around is based on the LEP’s ransom fund of gold. As a result, the world of the Fairy People feels more real and alive, which in turn makes the stories that unfold across both the fairy and human worlds more interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other main reason I love the <span class="italicstyle">Artemis Fowl</span> series is the characterization of its main character. Despite being only twelve years old, Artemis Fowl II is ruthless, intelligent, and devious. As the first novel states: “He still retained a childlike belief in magic, tempered by an adult determination to exploit it.” To that end, he successfully kidnaps a fairy and holds her for ransom in exchange for some of the fairies’ gold, which he plans to use to restore his family’s wealth. In the ensuing conflict, he also outwits the LEP at every turn. When I read the first <span class="italicstyle">Artemis Fowl</span> book, I was surprised that even though it was targeted at kids, it was unafraid to portray its protagonist with traditionally antagonistic qualities. I think that Artemis’s original characterization as a criminal mastermind helps the series stand out from other works in the children’s fantasy genre. In addition, the series allows its protagonist to grow and change—and become a more likable person. To me, Artemis is memorable not because of where he ended up as a character, but because of where he started. His character arc is believable and well-written, and in my opinion, is one of the best parts of the entire series.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I first heard about Disney’s <span class="italicstyle">Artemis Fowl</span> movie, I was very excited! After all, this was the first time the series was being adapted into a movie. I even reread the first book so I could evaluate the film’s faithfulness to its source material when I watched it. When I heard the movie was changing the gender of a secondary character, I was nervous because I felt that character’s gender was important in understanding one of the main characters. My excitement for the movie dropped considerably after I watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl2r3Fwxz_o" target="_blank" title="Click here to watch it, if you dare" class="normallink">most recent trailer</a> and realized the movie’s many changes didn’t stop there. For instance, in the film, Artemis’s father is kidnapped by fairies, whereas in the series, he did not appear until the second book and was never associated with fairies. I was also disappointed by the movie‘s portrayal of Artemis as more of a reluctant hero than a dedicated criminal mastermind. Of course, it’s not fair to judge a movie that hasn’t come out yet. I’ll still watch <span class="italicstyle">Artemis Fowl</span>, but I won’t judge it based on its faithfulness to the book since it’s clear the film is doing its own thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, if you’re interested in fantasy and science-fiction literature with a compelling and memorable protagonist, I highly recommend the <span class="italicstyle">Artemis Fowl</span> book series!
